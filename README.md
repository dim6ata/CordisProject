# CordisProject
### First university group Java development project, 2019-2020.

The project acts as an introduction to full stack development and the use of MVC design pattern. 
It provides a login/registration service, visualisation of a data subset as determined by the university task. 
The project is developed in NetBeans by using its form editor for the GUI. 

The project is still visible to portray the contrast between my initial learning stages as a developer and the more refined recent works.
